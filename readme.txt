An advanced version of the Genesis - Featured Page widget. Allows you to add a custom image, custom content, page excerpt, and more.

== Description ==

**Please Note:** This plugin is only for Genesis Framework users. Genesis is a premium product by [StudioPress](http://www.studiopress.com).

That said, most Genesis users have probably stumbled upon the *Genesis - Featured Page* widget as a great way to add page teasers/links to your homepage, footer, sidebars, or really any widget area.

However, sometimes you need additional functionality that is not offered in the core widget, such as adding a custom image or custom content. This is what *Genesis - Featured Page Advanced* does.  

= Plugin Highlights =
* **New:** Insert More Text on a new line
* **New:** Adjust the size of custom images
* Display widget title above or below image (Defaults above)
* Display page title above or below image (Defaults below)
* Adds option for widget to link to a custom link 
* Adds custom image upload field 
* Adds custom content field
* Adds option to display the page excerpt
* Adds option to remove the page link from the page title
* Adds option to add the page link to the widget title
* Adds option to remove the page link from the featured or custom image
* Fields show/hide based on user selection for cleaner UI 
* Works alongside the original *Genesis - Featured Page* widget and other third party widgets
* Uses the same CSS classes as the original Genesis widget, so any styling you are currently using will be passed to this widget
* Genesis 2.0 and HTML5 compatible 

If you are looking for additional features, let me know in the plugin support forum. 

**Disclaimer:** This plugin is essentially a forked version of the original *Genesis - Featured Page* widget. Props go to StudioPress for developing the widget, I just modified/enhanced it.

	* *Go to Plugins->Add New and search for "Genesis Featured Page Advanced". Once found, click "Install".
